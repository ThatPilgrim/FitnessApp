This repository contains all the files related to my fitness program.

This fitness program makes your fitness journey much easier by recommending different exercises to help you work out various muscles in your body.

It was written in Java and uses JavaFX to simplify the selection of different exercises by using dropdowns. It also showcases my understanding of SQL and its integration with Java to query the database for information, which is then displayed to the user.

In this program, you simply select the three muscle groups you want to start working on. You then choose the difficulty of the exercises on a scale ranging from Easy to Medium, Hard, and Extreme, where Extreme is the most difficult.

The program uses basic SQL queries to retrieve information from a database based on the user's selection and returns it to the Java program, which then uses JavaFX to display it in a more organized view.
